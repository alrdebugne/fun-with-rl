# How to install

## In MacOS

`gym` has been moved to `gymnasium`. Moreover, the package allowing to run Super Mario Bros. isn't supported any more. Instead, Gym Retro packages many more games and is compatible with `gymnasium`. The only issue... is that it doesn't run on macOS with M1/M2 chips.

After much fiddling, I decided to swallow the pill and revert to the `gym` version I was familiar with: `gym==0.21`.
